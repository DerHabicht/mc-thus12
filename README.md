# THUS Minecraft Server for 1.12.2
This repository is intended to version the configuration used for the THUS
Minecraft server. This uses the 
[THUS 12 modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/thus12).

## A Note About the Mods
For convenience in setting up and maintaining the server, the mod `.jar`s
themselves are stored in a repository using Git LFS that I submodule into this
repository. However, in order to protect the rights of the mod authors that
repository is going to be kept private in order to prevent that repo from
becoming a distribution point. If you want the mods themselves, you should
download them from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/thus12).
